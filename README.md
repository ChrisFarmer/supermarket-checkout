******** Advice on implementation



The purpose of this test is for you to demonstrate what you would consider to be Production Ready Good Quality code. Spend as much (or little) time as you feel is necessary to demonstrate your opinion of production quality code. 



A console app will do, don't spend all your time designing out a snazzy UI (unless you really want to :-), we won't be considering a UI as part of assessing the quality of the implementation. 



Feel free to implement the solution in either C# or Javascript.
